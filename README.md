# Crypto Website Project
This project is a cryptocurrency website built using .NET Core, React, and SQL. The website fetches cryptocurrency data from the CoinStats API to provide real-time information on various cryptocurrencies. It allows users to explore and track cryptocurrencies, view charts, and make small-scale predictions using KNN and decision tree algorithms.

## Project Description
The Crypto Website Project aims to create a user-friendly platform for users to gather information about different cryptocurrencies. The website provides real-time data on cryptocurrency prices, market trends, and other relevant information. Users can create accounts, favorite cryptocurrencies, track their portfolio, and make predictions based on KNN and decision tree algorithms.

The project utilizes the following technologies:
* __.NET Core__ : An open-source framework used for server-side development. It handles server operations, API integrations, and data management.
* __React__ : A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React is used to create dynamic and interactive components for the frontend of the website.
* __SQL__ :  A relational database management system used for storing user information, favorite cryptocurrencies, and portfolio data.

# Features
